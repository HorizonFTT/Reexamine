Food
Is
To
Body
So
Is
Learning
To
Mind
Our
Bodies
Grow
And
Muscles
Develop
With
Intake
Of
Adequate
Nutritious
Food
Likewise
We
Should
Keep
Learning
Day
By
Day
To
Maintain
Our
Keen
Mental
Power
And
Expand
Our
Intellectual
Capacity
Constant
Learning
Supplies
Us
With
Inexhaustible
Fuel
For
Driving
Us
To
Sharpen
Our
Power
Of
Reasoning
Analysis
And
Judgment
Learning
Incessantly
Is
Surest
Way
To
Keep
Pace
With
Times
In
Information
Age
And
An
Infallible
Warrant
Of
Success
In
Times
Of
Uncertainty
Once
Learning
Stops
Vegetation
Sets
In
It
Is
A
Common
Fallacy
To
Regard
School
As
Only
Workshop
For
Acquisition
Of
Knowledge
On
Contrary
Learning
Should
Be
A
Neverending
Process
From
Cradle
To
Grave
With

Ever
Changing
So

Cease
From

For
Just
A
Few
Days
Will
Make
A
Person
Lag
Behind
Whats
Worse
Animalistic
Instinct
Dormant
Deep
In
Our
Subconsciousness
Will
Come
To
Life
Weakening
Our
Will
To
Pursue
Our
Noble
Ideal
Sapping
Our
Determination
To
Sweep
Away
Obstacles
To
Our
Success
And
Strangling
Our
Desire
For
Refinement
Of
Our
Character
Lack
Of
Learning
Will
Inevitably
Lead
To
Stagnation
Of
Mind
Or
Even
Worse
Its
Fossilization
Therefore
To
Stay
Mentally
Young
We
Have
To
Take
Learning
As
A
Lifelong
Career
